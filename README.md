# MVVM-Swift
 
The Model View View Model (MVVM) architecture pattern is a structured approach to software development that includes three main components: the Model, the View, and the ViewModel. With the use of Firebase API, it provides a scalable back-end infrastructure for web and mobile applications. Firebase API offers real-time databases, hosting, storage, authentication, and cloud messaging services. In this project, MVVM with Firebase API was used for learning purposes. The aim of this project was to gain practical experience with MVVM and Firebase API and to build a scalable, maintainable, and real-time application. The Model represents the data and business logic, while the View represents the user interface. The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, exposing data to the View and updating the Model when the View is changed. By using MVVM with Firebase API, developers can create applications that are scalable, maintainable, and offer real-time updates.
